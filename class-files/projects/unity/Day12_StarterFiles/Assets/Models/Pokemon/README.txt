Designing a low-poly Pokemon is the best way I found to represent the poor graphic quality the first Pokemon games had. So, here I present you the low-poly Pikachu, which is part of the Low-Poly project I'm developing.   

3D printers allow to make real the idea of catching all Pokemon, and I'm currently working to make all the Pokemon I can. You can check the collection in the following page:   

http://www.thingiverse.com/FLOWALISTIK/collections/low-poly-pokemon   

This model is 5cm tall approximately. The model from the picture was printed with a Prusa i3, 0.2mm layer height, 0.5mm nozzle, 45mm/s speed and a cooling fan (I really recommend this!). The material is 3mm high quality PLA.   

It was designed so it doesn't need support material, although each printer is different and it may be more difficult to print it depending on the settings.
